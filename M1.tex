\title{Molecule 1 and Molecule 1 with 3h}
\begin{document}
Molecule is the made from three pentane ring joined together such that the angle between adjacent angle 111.004 degree 111.004 degree, 113.229 degree. The geometry was optimised using CAMB3LYP DFT functional and and cc-pVTZ basis set in both triplet and singlet state.\\*
Various other calculation were performed on the structure. Including casscf calculation and CCSD a
c^{*}-c^{1} = 14.3989 nm \\
c^{*}-c^{2} = 14.3939 nm\\
c^{*}-c^{3} = 13.4563 nm\\

In triplet structure the three central angle are 110.639 Degree 110.659 Degree 110.659 degree\\*
c^{*}-c^{1} = 1.39801 nm\\*
c^{*}-c^{2} = 1.39803 nm\\*
c^{*}-c^{3} = 1.39804 nm\\


so the triplet structure is more closed to the symmetric structure. 
as well as the  calculation were also performed on molecule one with 3h on
